# star-lamp-controller
This project is a simple replacement for the limited PCB that was built into the star sky lamp I bought.

### Goals:
- More control over the lights than the original PCB provided

### Functionality:

- Setting light properties over HTTP (implemented)
- Getting current light properties over HTTP (not yet implemented)
