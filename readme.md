# star-lamp-controller
This project is a simple replacement for the limited PCB that was built into the star sky lamp I bought.
Serves as a basis for ["alx-esphome-devices/esphome-starlamp"](https://github.com/AlxDoesStuff/alx-esphome-devices/tree/main/esphome-starlamp)

### Goals:
- More control over the lights than the original PCB provided

### Functionality:

- Setting light properties over HTTP (implemented)
- Getting current light properties over HTTP (not yet implemented)
